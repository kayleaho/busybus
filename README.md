Project Brief: Busy Bus

Background Information

Due to expansion, numerous routes have been added in a town near you and many of those routes stop at the same bus stop. Riders want to know what the next arriving bus is and how much time they have to get to the bus stop. Simply rushing to the stop when you see a bus coming no longer works because it might not be the bus the rider is expecting. Riders are currently complaining the most about the bus stop at Washington and State, which has seven bus lines serving the stop.


Project Brief

The main issues to solve for BusyBus app are to let the users know what the next arriving bus is and how much time they have to get to the bus stop. Since the problem is based on the Washington and State station in particular, the app was designed to revolve around that one station.

The bus location page and schedule page to solve the two issues. The two pages can be easily accessed as the buttons that lead to them are placed at the bottom bar. As the app focuses on Washington and State station, both of the pages are based on the particular station.

Users can use the search bar to search routes to his/her destination. As a result, the application shows the best bus to take. While a user searches for route options, he/she could go back to search suggestions/history or quickly go back to home by tapping on the top right button to access schedule and bus locations.


Challenges
1. I wanted to `position: fixed;` the statusBar and lowerBar. However, whenever I applied it, the bars were pushed to the left and some of the icons disappeared.
2. I cannot find a way to horizontally line up/center the .left and .right.
**Issues have been resolved.**
